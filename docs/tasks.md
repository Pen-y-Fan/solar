# Solar Project Improvement Tasks

Last updated: 2025-09-06 21:31

This document provides a comprehensive checklist of improvement tasks for the Solar project. Each task is marked with a
checkbox [ ] that can be checked off when completed.

Note on prioritization: Tasks are grouped and ordered to align with the phased approach in docs/plan.md (Phase 1:
Foundation and Security, Phase 2: Performance and Data Management, Phase 3: User Experience and Documentation). When
updating progress, ensure work proceeds broadly in this order unless justified otherwise.

    8. Document developer workflow

    - [x] Update docs/actions.md with CQRS guidance and examples
- [ ] 
    9. Incremental rollout & toggles

    - [ ] Adopt commands for new complex writes immediately; migrate existing features opportunistically
    - [ ] Keep Actions delegating to handlers to avoid wide changes
    - [ ] Track progress here as we complete each subtask
- [ ] 
    10. Next Phase 1 increments (small, verifiable)

    - [x] Migrate AgileChart update paths to use CommandBus for write operations (ImportAgileRatesCommand,
      ExportAgileRatesCommand) while keeping reads via query
    - [x] Add a Query for a second UI read path (e.g., latest N Strategy rows for dashboard) and cover with a test

      SyncOctopusAccount (assert ActionResult::failure with messages)
    - [x] Add a convention test asserting CommandBus has mappings for core commands (GenerateStrategy,
      Import/ExportAgileRates, SyncOctopusAccount)
    - [x] Add basic logging in handlers (start/end + timing) without middleware;
        - [x] cover with a Log::spy based unit test
    - [x] Add docs/actions.md example showing a simple Filament component consuming a Query (read-only)

- [ ]

    - [ ] Add Command + Handler: CopyConsumptionWeekAgoCommand(+Handler) to wrap write logic in CopyConsumptionWeekAgoAction; update UI action to dispatch via CommandBus.
    - [ ] Add Query: InverterConsumptionByTimeQuery to support any widgets/tables that aggregate inverter consumption (if applicable); add unit test and integrate where used.
    - [ ] Add Command + Handler: RefreshForecastsCommand(+Handler) to coordinate ActualForecastAction and ForecastAction with transaction/logging; wire to any UI triggers or scheduler if present.
    - [x] Add Bus mapping entries in AppServiceProvider for the new commands and cover with a CommandBusMappingsTest update.
    - [x] Add unit tests for the new handlers (happy/unhappy paths) and update any affected Feature tests.
    - [ ] Add Command + Handler: RecalculateStrategyCostsCommand(+Handler) to recompute cost-related fields for a Strategy across a date range; ensure idempotency and transaction safety; update any maintenance UI to use the command.
    - [ ] Add Command + Handler: RebalanceBatteryScheduleCommand(+Handler) to generate/adjust charge-discharge schedule based on latest forecasts and tariffs; log decisions; wire to UI or scheduler if applicable.
    - [ ] Add Command + Handler: SyncInverterMetricsCommand(+Handler) to fetch and persist telemetry from inverter APIs; encapsulate retries and error handling; expose via scheduler/CLI.
    - [ ] Add Query: StrategyPerformanceSummaryQuery returning KPIs (savings, export revenue, self-consumption) per day/week; cover with unit tests and integrate into dashboard/widget.
    - [ ] Add Query: EnergyCostBreakdownByDayQuery to provide stacked costs (import/export/net) for charts; optimize with DB-level aggregation; unit test and integrate where used.
    - [ ] Add Command + Handler: BulkImportAgileRatesCommand(+Handler) to import a date range of rates efficiently with upsert; reuse existing single-day logic; guard against duplicates.
    - [ ] Add Command + Handler: PurgeOldForecastsCommand(+Handler) to archive or delete stale forecast rows beyond retention; include dry-run option and logging; add a Console command if needed.
    - [ ] Update Filament widgets/controllers to consume new Queries (read paths) and dispatch new Commands (write paths) without leaking implementation details.
    - [ ] Extend CommandBus mappings and add/adjust a convention test to assert handlers exist for all new commands.
    - [ ] Add Feature tests covering one UI flow per new command/query integration (happy and failure messaging paths).

    Implementation details and acceptance criteria for the above (expand as you work):
    - [x] CalculateBatteryCommand
      - [x] Inputs: strategy_id or date range; options to simulate vs persist.
      - [x] Handler: validate inputs; DB::transaction; delegate to existing CalculateBatteryAction; return ActionResult; Log start/end with timing.
      - [x] Mapping: bind Command => Handler in SimpleCommandBus via AppServiceProvider.
      - [x] Tests: unit happy/unhappy; if applicable, a small feature test for Filament action dispatch.
      - [ ] Done when:
        - [x] Filament CalculateBattery UI calls $bus->dispatch(new CalculateBatteryCommand(...)).
        - [ ] Add a Feature test asserting the Filament action dispatches via CommandBus and shows success/error toasts.
        - [x] Logs include "CalculateBatteryCommand started/finished" with ms timing.
        - [x] Unit tests assert success and validation failure; optional feature test asserts toast messaging.
    - [ ] CopyConsumptionWeekAgoCommand
      - [ ] Inputs: strategy_id and target date(s).
      - [ ] Handler: validate; transaction; delegate to CopyConsumptionWeekAgoAction; return ActionResult; basic logging.
      - [ ] Mapping + Tests as above.
      - [ ] Done when:
        - [ ] Filament CopyConsumption UI dispatches the command via bus.
        - [ ] Failure path returns ActionResult::failure with messages and logs a warning.
    - [ ] RefreshForecastsCommand
      - [ ] Purpose: orchestrate ActualForecastAction then ForecastAction for a date or range.
      - [ ] Handler: transaction boundary where safe; catch/report failures; return ActionResult with messages; logging.
      - [ ] Wire-up: expose via scheduler/Artisan and any existing UI triggers.
      - [ ] Done when:
        - [ ] Artisan command (e.g., forecasts:refresh) or scheduler uses the command.
        - [ ] Unit tests cover both Actual and Forecast actions success/failure and aggregated messages.
    - [ ] Queries (InverterConsumptionByTime, StrategyPerformanceSummary, EnergyCostBreakdownByDay)
      - [ ] Return DTOs/arrays optimized for widgets/tables; avoid side-effects; add unit tests.
      - [ ] Integrate into widgets/controllers where aggregation currently happens inline.
      - [ ] Done when:
        - [ ] At least one widget/controller is switched to the Query and unit test covers shape of response.
    - [ ] BulkImportAgileRatesCommand
      - [ ] Inputs: date range; tariff id.
      - [ ] Handler: chunk by day; reuse single-day import; upsert; guard duplicates; return ActionResult with counts.
      - [ ] Done when:
        - [ ] Command processes multi-day range and returns counts; duplicates are skipped (asserted in unit test).
    - [ ] PurgeOldForecastsCommand
      - [ ] Inputs: retention window; dry-run flag.
      - [ ] Handler: select candidates; optionally delete/archive; log summary; return ActionResult; optional Console command.
      - [ ] Done when:
        - [ ] Dry-run outputs candidate counts only; real run deletes/archives and returns counts; unit tests cover both.
    - [ ] Bus mappings and convention tests
      - [ ] Update AppServiceProvider to register new Command => Handler pairs.
      - [ ] Extend CommandBusMappingsTest to assert each new Command is mapped.
      - [ ] Done when:
        - [ ] Convention test fails if a new Command lacks a handler mapping.
    - [ ] Feature coverage
      - [ ] For at least one new command and one new query integration, add a feature test covering success and failure messaging in the UI.
      - [ ] Done when:
        - [ ] Feature test asserts UI shows success toast on success and error toast on failure path.
