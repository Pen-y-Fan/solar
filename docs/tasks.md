# Solar Project Improvement Tasks

Last updated: 2025-09-28 20:04

This document provides a comprehensive checklist of improvement tasks for the Solar project. Each task is marked with a
checkbox [ ] that can be checked off when completed.

Note on prioritization: Tasks are grouped and ordered to align with the phased approach in docs/plan.md (Phase 1:
Foundation and Security, Phase 2: Performance and Data Management, Phase 3: User Experience and Documentation). When
updating progress, ensure work proceeds broadly in this order unless justified otherwise.
