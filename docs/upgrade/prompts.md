This project has just been successfully upgraded to the latest version of Laravel 11. Next, I would like to upgrade to laravel 12.

Using the `docs/upgrade/upgrade11to12.md` file as a reference, analyze the codebase and identify impact changes. Create a detailed list of actionable improvement tasks and save it as an enumerated checklist to `docs/upgrade/upgrade-tasks.md`. Each item should start with a placeholder [ ] to be checked off when completed. Ensure the tasks are logically ordered and cover all upgrade Impact Changes.

-----

Iteratively implement the upgrade based on the task list in `docs/upgrade/upgrade-tasks.md`. After completing each task, mark it as done by changing the checkbox from [ ] to [x]. Ensure each change aligns with the style guidelines in `.junie/guidelines.md`.
